# Sophie and Champagne Website

Main page that is straight up HTML/CSS/JS without a framework.
This way adding new links to the main page is simple and does
not need a build step.
This also allows the other framwork built site to just redirect
to main to get new sub-sites with having to be rebuilt for each
addition.
